## Description
This project provides more accessability features to the Horiseon Social Solution Services. With the new edited code this project easily allows the user to understand the flow and importance of each element. This project taught me the importance of orginization and how much easier it is working with clean code.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
Code is now blocked into workable pieces, follows a logical pattern, and is displayed as such. Side includes new accessablility features as well, such as alt text for images.
